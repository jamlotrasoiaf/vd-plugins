# VD Plugins
This repo contains my plugins for [Bunny](https://github.com/pyoncord/Bunny).

I cannot guarantee functionality in Vendetta or any other fork of it as I only test my plugins in Bunny.

# How to install?
Go to Settings > Plugins, click the floating action button at bottom right, then paste the URL of the plugin you want to install.
